# Test outcomes
launchPrompt: Welcome to Activity Finder. I can recommend restaurants, attractions or general things to do in your local area or anywhere in the world! I can also create an itinerary and email it to you. If you would like some tips on how to use the skill say, "tell me more". To start, try saying, "Recommend a local restaurant".
helpPrompt: Try saying, "Recommend something in my local area" or, "Recommend a cafe in Sydney". Then, when you have heard my recommendations, you can ask me to pin a location by saying, "Pin hardrock cafe", for example. This will add a location to your itinerary. You can also ask to "pin everything". Once you're finished adding to your itinerary, ask me to send it to you by saying, "email me".
